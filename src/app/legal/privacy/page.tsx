      <h1>Privacy Policy for The Wealth Map</h1>
      <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> {new Date().toLocaleDateString()}</p>

      <p>
        Welcome to The Wealth Map. Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information.
      </p>

      <h2>1. The Core Principle: Your Data is Yours</h2>
      <p>
        The Wealth Map is designed from the ground up to be a privacy-first application. <strong>We do not collect, store, transmit, or have any access to your personal or financial data.</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>2. Local Storage</h2>
      <p>
        All the data you enter into the application—including your name, goals, transactions, reflections, and wealth wheel assessments—is stored exclusively on your own device (phone, computer, tablet) using your browser's local storage technology.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The data never leaves your device.</li>
        <li>We, the developers of The Wealth Map, cannot see or access your information.</li>
        <li>If you clear your browser's data or uninstall the application, your data will be permanently deleted.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. AI Features</h2>
      <p>
        The AI Coach and Chatbot features process your data to provide insights. This processing also happens locally or is sent anonymously and ephemerally to a generative AI service. The data is used only to generate the response in that moment and is not stored or used to train any AI models.
      </p>
      
      <h2>4. No Accounts, No Servers</h2>
      <p>
        This application does not require you to create an account. Since all data is stored locally, there is no need for user authentication or a central server to store your information.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
      <p>
